I made my own dev textures with surface properties for more comfortable blocking, since default "reflective30b" is not enough sometimes. When it comes to test bullet penetration or sound planning, these textures might be quite handy!

**How to use:**
1. Download zip by clicking "Code" button
2. Unpack "materials" folder to content/csgo_addons/addon_name
3. Using asset browser you can now find dev textures by simpling typing something like "dev texture" or "dev wood" or "dev plaster" etc.
4. You also can find hot spot materials by adding "hs" or "trim" in search query
5. Some of them are pretinted, but you can also use non tinted variants and color them in hammer editor as you like.
